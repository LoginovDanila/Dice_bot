# Telegtam bot for rolling dices and generate stats 

DnD staff for IT-wizards!
This bot for could roll the dice and generate new character's stats using the classic algorithm from the Player's handbook.

For great work of this bot, you need:
1. TOKEN from @bot_father
2. 4 images for every side of every dice (d20, d12, d10, d6, d4)
3. You need to place images from p.2 to the folders like (D4/1/1_1.jfif or D6/6/6_2.jfif)
